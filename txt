Act as a world-class Senior UI/UX Designer and Streaming Platform Experience Architect.
Your task is to redesign the WatchPageClient of a movie/TV streaming application.
The current design looks outdated and unprofessional. Create a fully responsive, clean, user-friendly, modern Watch Page that works perfectly across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). The video player must be fully responsive and behave like a premium streaming platform (Netflix / YouTube-level UX).


Requirements for the redesign (conceptual only, no styling):
1. Fully responsive video player

Must scale fluidly with container width and maintain aspect ratio.

Controls: play/pause, seek bar, volume, captions, settings, fullscreen, PiP.

Mobile gestures: single tap to show controls, double tap to seek.

Controls auto-hide and reappear on interaction.

Keyboard shortcuts: space, arrows, F, M.

Adaptive layout: full controls on desktop, compact controls on mobile.

2. Responsive page layout

Desktop:

Two-column structure: video player + metadata/actions + episode list/related items.

Tablet:

Stacked layout with the player at top and content sections below.

Mobile:

Player first, collapsible metadata, scroll-friendly layout, sticky mini controls bar.

3. Metadata & actions (structure only)

Title, season/episode, runtime, genres, description (expand/collapse).

Logical grouping and prioritization for quick scanning.

4. Episode list (structure only)

Vertical or horizontal scroll depending on device size.

Highlight current episode.

Smooth interaction when switching episodes.

5. Related content section

Responsive grid that scales down to single-column on mobile.

6. Accessibility & usability

Semantic HTML structure.

ARIA roles for player controls.

Readable touch targets (mobile).

Logical keyboard focus order.

7. Performance considerations

Lazy-load comments and related content.

Efficient video loading and minimal blocking scripts.

Responsive images and optimized DOM.

Deliverables expected (no style rules)

Layout wireframes for mobile/tablet/desktop.

Component breakdown: player, metadata block, episode list, related section.

Interaction notes: how each UI element behaves.

Functional prototype for user flows (playback, episode switching).

Developer-ready UX specification.
